         * 
         * @note Wrapper of `this.node()`.
         * @note The depth is measured from the root of the document, where the root 
         *       node (usually the document itself) is at depth 0. This method allows 
         *       you to navigate the document tree and access ancestor nodes at 
         *       various levels of the hierarchy.
         * 
         * @param depth The depth level from the root at which to retrieve the node. 
         *   - Depth 0 always refers to the root document node.
         *   - A positive depth value specifies the nth level down from the root node.
         *   - When `depth` is negative, it is added to the current depth of the 
         *     resolved position, effectively moving upwards in the document tree. 
         *     This allows for relative upward navigation from the current node.
         * 
         * @note The method returns `undefined` if the specified depth exceeds the 
         *       bounds of the document structure, meaning the depth is greater than 
         *       the total number of levels in the document tree.
         * @note When using negative depths, if the calculated depth (current depth 
         *       + negative depth) is less than 0, the method will return undefined, 
         *       as it cannot go above the root of the document tree.
         * 
         * @example
         * ```ts
         * // Given a document structure:
         * // <doc>
         * //   <paragraph>Hello, </paragraph>
         * //   <paragraph>world!</paragraph>
         * // </doc>
         * 
         * // Assuming `pos` is a resolved position in the second paragraph:
         * pos.node();        // Returns the second <paragraph> node
         * pos.node(0);       // Returns the <doc> node
         * pos.node(pos.depth); // Same as pos.node(), returns the second <paragraph> node
         * pos.node(-1);      // Returns the parent of the node at the current position, which is also the <doc> node
         * 
         * // For a nested structure like:
         * // <doc>
         * //   <blockquote>
         * //     <paragraph>One</paragraph>
         * //     <paragraph>Two<img /></paragraph>
         * //   </blockquote>
         * // </doc>
         * 
         * // Assuming `pos` is inside the <paragraph> containing "Two":
         * pos.node(-1); // Returns the <paragraph> node containing "Two"
         * pos.node(-2); // Returns the <blockquote> node

         * 
         * ### Example 1: Positions within the same section but different paragraphs
         * 
         * Consider a document structured as:
         * 
         * ```plaintext
         * doc (depth 0)
         * └── section (depth 1)
         *     ├── paragraph (depth 2)
         *     │   └── text "Hello" (depth 3)
         *     └── paragraph (depth 2)
         *         └── text "World" (depth 3)
         * ```
         * 
         * ```js
         * const resolvedPos1 = doc.resolve(2);   // Inside first paragraph ("Hello")
         * const resolvedPos2 = doc.resolve(12);  // Inside second paragraph ("World")
         * 
         * // Since both positions are in different paragraphs but share the same section,
         * // the common ancestor depth will be 1 (the section node).
         * const sharedDepth = resolvedPos1.getCommonAncestorDepth(resolvedPos2.pos);
         * console.log(sharedDepth);  // Output: 1
         * ```
         * 
         * ### Example 2: One position is at the root and another is deep in the document
         * 
         * Consider a document structured similarly to Example 1. 
         * 
         * ```js
         * const resolvedPos1 = doc.resolve(0);   // Position at the start of the document (root)
         * const resolvedPos2 = doc.resolve(4);   // Inside first paragraph ("Hello")
         * 
         * // The only common ancestor is the root (depth 0), so the result is 0.
         * const sharedDepth = resolvedPos1.getCommonAncestorDepth(resolvedPos2.pos);
         * console.log(sharedDepth);  // Output: 0
         * ```
         * 
         * @param pos The position to compare with this one.
         * @returns The depth of the shared ancestor node, or 0 if the only common 
         *          ancestor is the root node.
